# About

With offices in China, Philippines, Malaysia and India, ihD Ltd is headquartered in Hong Kong, specialising in IT, ELV & Security, and Audio-Visual Systems, as well as Mechanical & Architectural Acoustics, design and Consultancy. Our company is not involved in any way in the supply of equipment nor in installation. We focus instead on Design, Consultancy, and Project Management, allowing us to remain independent, specifying equipment and systems most-suited to our client’s technical and budgetary needs.

We are proud of our reputation for excellence in both our design and our project handling. Although we do not supply or install, our Team members have long years of hands-on experience with project management, making us uniquely able to assess and aid the progress and workmanship of the Integrators appointed, ensuring a successful completion every time.

ihD’s Principal Audio-Visual Consultant Ian D. Harris BSc (Hons), C.Eng, MIEE, CTS-D is based in our Hong Kong Head Office, but every office has a Team of dedicated, passionate and pro-active experts building great projects for our Clients.
