## Scope of services provided

ihD provides essential and timely professional consultancy in the ELV, IT, PABX, Security, Audio-Visual, and Acoustics disciplines, with fully-detailed design services carried out entirely in-house:

- **ELV Extra-Low Voltage Systems.** Design, comprising the extra-low voltage systems for Facilities, such as Building Management Automation, Car Park Management system, Guestroom Management Systems, and more

- **IT Information Technology Service.** Full infrastructure design with full wired optical fibre & copper. As well as wireless network design (using heat map simulation for the wireless modelling), server rooms, and ELV/Telecom closets. PABX, IP and also hybrid IP/analogue, as many clients need to meet restricted budgets, and we are able to design to best-suit these, whilst still offering the users sufficient facilities. IOT Internet of Things is naturally included, as well as embracing various presently-Edge-Technologies

- **Security Systems.** Design, incorporating various mixes of surveillance and access-control, as well as Threat-Analysis, Layer 1/2/3 security design, explosives and gun-detection, Guard Tour, MATV/SMATV, IPTV, Lighting Control, PA, Intercom, Car Park Management, Building-Automation/BMS, Guestroom Management Systems. Use of analytics for intelligent and effective surveillance, as well as building-setback and Electronic perimeter defence

- **Audio-Visual Systems.** Design all of the Audio, Video, and Control Systems, with Networked AV and Communications, and audio-modelling and simulation for complex/demanding sound spaces, as well as large-format LED and projection-mapping display

- **Architectural & Mechanical Acoustics.** Covering sound isolation via walls, floors, glazing, and doors, reverberation control through material finishes and structural considerations, and mechanical/vibration-isolation of motorised and other plant and machinery, as well as traffic noise and various other challenging real-life situations. Noise/vibration-mitigation services are also provided for built-structures, as well as noise surveys


## Executive Strategy

Generally, our scope is to co-ordinate with the Clients representatives, Project Managers, and other consultants and contractors to ensure their requirements are met, designing systems, and producing a full set of Tender Documentation, as well as agreeing on the overall budget with the client. Assisting in Contractor-selection and monitoring the project progress and also installation quality, as well as testing and commissioning. Typically the work is executed in several pre-agreed stages:

Develop initial budgets, and preliminary cable & fibre containment requirements. For Audio-Visual, also issue structural loading estimates for Ballrooms and similar, and for Acoustics, traffic noise survey with Facade- and related design recommendations
- **Stage B - Schematic Design.** Negotiate for,  and secure, all of the equipment rooms. Develop overall outline System Schematics, and develop preliminary plan and Reflected Ceiling Plan layouts, as well as issue target performance data
- **Stage C - Detailed Design**, wherein we fully-co-ordinate and produce all of the physical layout drawings, E&M interface specifications and requirements, detailed system schematics, detailed descriptions, and equipment specifications. Fine-tune costings ND DEVELOP THE Bill of Quatities/Schedule of Rates. For Acoustics, work with the MEP and the architects to embed required acoustic measures and performance parameters into their designs
- **Stage D - Tender Documentation,** finalizing the Detailed Design along with the Bill Of Quantities, technical and project requirements specifications, issuing to the bidding parties for competitive pricing. This and the next stage are what saves our clients large sums of money compared with the Design/Build process
