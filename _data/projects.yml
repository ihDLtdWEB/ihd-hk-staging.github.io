  description: JJ’s Bar, renowned across Asia in its day, was re-designed by ihD with a complete 3D-modelling of its labyrinthine network. The solution was a perfectly-reproduced live band sound throughout the stage, dance floor, passageways and bar areas. Designed by the renowned architect & interior designer John Morford, JJ's Bar was another extremely challenging yet successful project.
